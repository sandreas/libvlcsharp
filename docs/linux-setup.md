# Getting started on LibVLCSharp for Linux

[Back](home.md)

_This procedure was tested on ubuntu 20.10. If you have another distribution, make sure that all requirements are available, and adapt the following commands_

1. Install the [.net core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)
2. Install **libvlc**: 

For ubuntu:
> `sudo apt install libvlc-dev`. 

*`libvlc.so` and `libvlccore.so` will be located at `/usr/lib`.*
Should you want to load the libvlc libraries from another location than `/usr/lib`, you'd need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

You may need:
> `sudo apt install vlc`

## For [gtk-sharp](https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp)

Install **gtk-sharp** (or monodevelop which uses it)

For ubuntu:
> `sudo apt install gtk-sharp2`

## For other platforms


If you are using the *X Window System*, it has to be initialized for multithreading support and this requires you to natively import `libx11`.

If your application doesn't find `libX11.so`, you may need to install the `libx11-dev` package :
> `sudo apt install libx11-dev`

Code example:
```c#
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace myApp;

public static class ImportHelper
{
    public struct Native
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Initializes the X threading system
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>Linux X11 only</remarks>
        /// <returns>non-zero on success, zero on failure</returns>
        [DllImport("libX11", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
        public static extern int XInitThreads();

    }
}

```

Usage:

```c#
// initialize multithreading support
ImportHelper.Native.XInitThreads();


// player initialization
using var libvlc = new LibVLC(enableDebugLogs: true);
using var media = new Media(libvlc, new Uri(@"C:\tmp\big_buck_bunny.mp4"));
using var mediaplayer = new MediaPlayer(media);

mediaplayer.Play();

Console.ReadKey();
```
